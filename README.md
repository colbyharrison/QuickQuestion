# QuickQuestion

Project Goal: Enable getting questions answered fast through incentivizing those with answers. 

How: A Questioner will be able to ask a question with some bounty attached to it. The answer that the questioner thinks is right will receive that bounty. 

More details to come...


This is the on chain code for creating question bounties. There will be additional repositories to hold the off chain code.


Rent and Data decisions: To limit the amount of rent that will be due questions and answers will be limited to 2500 characters. There will also need to be some limit of answers to a question. 

Additionally this contract will be for the individual bounty. And will not hold reference to the history of all bounties, this will be handled off chain.
