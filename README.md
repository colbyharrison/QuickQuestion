# QuickQuestion

(Project is WIP)

### Goal: 
Enable getting questions answered fast through incentivizing those with answers. 

### How: 
A Questioner will be able to ask a question with some bounty attached to it. Responders will be able to answer. The responders whos answer is accepted will receive the bounty.

More details to come...

This is the on chain code for creating question bounties. There will be additional repositories to hold the off chain code.


### Rent and Data decisions: 
To limit the amount of rent that will be due questions and answers will be limited to a character length. Additionally there will be a limit to the number of answers to a question. (WIP)

Additionally this contract will be for the individual bounty. And will not hold reference to the history of all bounties, this will be handled off chain.
